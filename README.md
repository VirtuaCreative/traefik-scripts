# Traefik Proxy on K8s

This reop contains the resource files to launch Traefik Proxy on a Kubernetes cluster.

To make our lives easier, instead of having to copy and paste them manually, I created a very simple script
to curl the files into a directory of our choice and apply them to an exixting cluster.

My env: Minikube / Docker on macOS X
